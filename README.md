##### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Status :heavy_exclamation_mark:
Should work on all regions as long as the opcodes are mapped. Thanks to EME's recent unjustified DMCA actions against developers, opcodes for NA are no longer mapped.

##### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Installation for Caali's tera-proxy :heavy_exclamation_mark:
1) Download pocket-surgeon: https://github.com/TeraProxy/pocket-surgeon/archive/master.zip
2) Extract the contents of the zip file into "\tera-proxy\bin\node_modules\"
3) Done! (the module will auto-update when a new version is released)

# pocket-surgeon
A tera-proxy module able to change visual effects and voice of your character (client-side).  
Changes to your character are saved on your hard drive and reloaded on next login.  
This is a rewrite of my original Surgeon module without race and gender change emulation since changing those client side will lead to out-of-sync animations (it was a fun proof of concept though).

## Usage  
While in game, open a proxy chat session by typing "/proxy" or "/8" in chat and hitting the space bar.  
This serves as the script's command interface.  
The following commands are supported:  

* surgeon height [x] - changes your height to x, default is 0, e.g. "surgeon height -3"
* surgeon chest [x] - changes your chest to x, default is 0, e.g. "surgeon chest -3"
* surgeon thighs [x] - changes your thighs to x, default is 0, e.g. "surgeon thighs -3"
* surgeon voice [0-5] - changes your voice pitch, e.g. "surgeon voice 1"
* surgeon reset - resets your changes, relog afterwards to get your original voice back
* surgeon [effect] - toggle an effect on and off, see below for valid effects

Any other input, starting with "surgeon", will return a summary of above commands in the chat.

## Safety
Whatever you send to the proxy chat in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.  
All changes are only present on your client. Nothing gets changed on the server.
